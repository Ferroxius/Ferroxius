Greetings,
They call me Ferroxius.
I'm not one well versed in coding but I am good at coming up with ideas.
I am however well versed in modding Witcher 3 so feel free to ask about issues (Within reason).
I also created and run a modding guide for W3 based around EE, a popular overhaul mod https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5777
